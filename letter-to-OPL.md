I kindly request that all courtesies and cooperation be extended to Mr. Mayor Godiya during the term of our lease agreement. This includes access to all amenities, prompt attention to any maintenance issues that may arise, and the full enjoyment of the property as per the terms of our lease and the rules and regulations of Oaklands Housing Scheme.
